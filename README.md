All old code for the Automatic License Place Recognition System that we wrote in 2009-2010.
When I say old I meant that. I just fished this code from my old hard drive and didn't try running. But it shouldn't be very hard for you to get this going if you are really interested.

Roughly the requirements will be:
* OpenCV - http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/
* OpenCV cvBlobsLib - http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/cvBlobsLib
* Tesseract
* Qt4
